<p>Having taken all the above input from the user, the system checks for any false entries like the departure date on the return trip being earlier than the departure date on the onward trip. In case of incompatibility, the system shall display a suitable error message and prompt the user to enter the information correctly.

Having taken all of the information as laid out above in 3.3.1 and 3.3.4, the system shall now access the flight schedule database ‘DB-schedule’ and queries it using the input provided by the user.

The system queries the reservation database ‘DB-reservations’ to check which of the flights on the schedule have seats available. The system displays the results in a suitable form (a tabular form) with the following information depicted – for each flight number – the flight number, departure time in origin city, arrival time in destination city, the duration of the flight (taking into account the possibility of a change of time zone) and the number of seats available on that flight.</p>
